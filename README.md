# Experimenting mobile technologies with forecast app

The idea of this project is to experiment what are the new technologies and languages in mobile development. As a proof of concept, the idea will be to create a simple forecast app, inspired by iPhone's Weather app.

## Open Weather Map

The data to bake this experiment will be taken from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org), more specefically this [resource](https://openweathermap.org/current).

## Mockups

Located under [`/mockups`](/mockups) folder, there will be three screens:

### Forecast screen

### Saved cities screen

## Apps features

* First screen (Forecast screen) will display the weather for the user's current location;
* User can add cities by name. They will be displayed in the forecast screen under a carousel;

## Icons

Located under [`/icons`](/icons) folder, they were made by [Smashicons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons) in [Flaticons](https://www.flaticon.com/)

This is the set of icons used in the experiment: https://www.flaticon.com/packs/weather-set-2
